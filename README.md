GenericLauncher
================

A base for Minecraft PE hacked clients. Starts you off with a basic launcher base that you can use to build off of. Currently just starts up and plays MCPE like normal, make it do what you want.

Take the code, and do what you want with it. It's a base for anyone to use. Change the package name, don't give me cradit, I don't care.


A few thanks to @zhuowei. This app is a barebones base of his app, BlockLauncher.
